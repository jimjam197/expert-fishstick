Sure! Here's a pseudo-code representation of the concept and flow of this project:

1. Define global variables:
   - `electronicsBtn`, `jewelryBtn`, `mensClothingBtn`, `womensClothingBtn`: Buttons for filtering products by category.
   - `displayDiv`: Container to display product cards.
   - `cartButton`, `clearCartBtn`, `checkoutBtn`: Buttons for managing the shopping cart.
   - `apiUrl`: Base URL for the Fake Store API.
   - `cart`: Array to store the items in the cart.

2. Create a function `fakeStore` to fetch data from the Fake Store API:
   - Accepts an `endpoint` as an argument.
   - Fetches data from the API using `fetch` and `await`.
   - Converts the response to JSON.
   - Calls the `displayCards` function with the retrieved data to display product cards.

3. Add event listeners to the category buttons:
   - When a category button is clicked, call the `fakeStore` function with the corresponding endpoint for that category.

4. Create a function `displayCards` to render product cards on the page:
   - Clears the `displayDiv`.
   - Creates two rows to arrange the product cards.
   - Loops through the data retrieved from the API and creates a card for each product.
   - Each card includes an image, title, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
   - Appends the cards to the respective rows in the `displayDiv`.

5. Create helper functions for creating dropdown buttons, collapse divs, and card content divs.

6. Create a function `submitToCart` to add items to the shopping cart:
   - Checks if the item already exists in the cart by matching its `id`.
   - If the item exists, increments the `quantity` of the item in the cart.
   - If the item does not exist, adds the item to the cart with a quantity of 1.

7. Create a function `displayCart` to show the cart modal:
   - Gets the cart table element.
   - Clears the cart table.
   - If the cart is empty, displays a message indicating the cart is empty.
   - Calculates the subtotal, tax, shipping, and total amount of the items in the cart.
   - Appends rows to the cart table with item details and expense breakdown.

8. Create a function `clearCart` to clear the shopping cart:
   - Resets the `cart` array to an empty array.

9. Add event listeners to the cart button, clear cart button, and checkout button:
   - When the cart button is clicked, call the `displayCart` function to show the cart modal.
   - When the clear cart button is clicked, call the `clearCart` function and update the displayed cart.
   - When the checkout button is clicked, show an alert message for the purchase confirmation, clear the cart, and update the displayed cart.

That's the pseudo-code representation of the concept and flow of this project.
